The Cartoonifying Images project transforms photographs into cartoon-like visuals using machine learning
techniques like CNNs and OpenCV. It involves edge detection, color quantization, and style transfer to create
high-quality cartoon representations while preserving key features. The project outperforms traditional methods
and has applications in digital art, entertainment, and advertising. It highlights the fusion of technology and
creativity for innovative visual experiences.
